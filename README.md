# Project-1

Our group evaluated a data set that polled a population regarding their music listening habits and their self-reported levels of anxiety, depression
insomnia and OCD.

Given that this data set is about self-reported mental health, we must be careful when drawing any inferences or conclusions regarding the population. 
Thus, our group chose to frame our project and mindset as a research project. For the purpose of analysis, we imagined this poll was the first stage in
a series of evalutions to best understand our population and its relationship to mental health. Most importantly, for our final analysis, we're thinking
about how this data will shape the next steps in our research. 

e.g. What other questions would we want to ask to get a better understanding of a popualation? What data seems to have no statistical significnce and is it 
worth further inquiry? 

The questions we explored are as follows: 

1. Is there a relationship between Rock Music and Metal Music and self-reported levels of mental illness?
2. If there a positive relationship between classic music and self-reported levels of mental illness? 
3. Is there any relationship between Rock cusic, Metal music, and Classical music and self-reported levels of mental illness? 
4. What is the statistical relationship for the percent of the population who listen to music during work hours and self-reported levels of anxiety?
5. What’s the relationship between generations, listening to music, and the self reported level of anxiety, insomnia, and OCD?
6. What’s the relationship between the bpm of music and the self reported level of mental health illness?
7. Is there any relationship between the favorite genres of the respondents and mental health conditions scale within different segments? 
8. Does music help improve or worsen mental health conditions across different segments?
